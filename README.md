# AlbumWorks | Test #

## 1st Test ##
For the API test: I deployed the REST API to Heroku which you can access through this link: [AlbumWorksTest](https://albumworkstest.herokuapp.com/)

or just use this plain url: https://albumworkstest.herokuapp.com/

<br>

#### LONG PROCESS: Test API using POSTMAN ####
Open **POSTMAN** application. Paste this endpoint: https://albumworkstest.herokuapp.com/letters.php then click Body->Raw then
select JSON then paste the sample json payload which you can copy below.

#### QUICK PROCESS: TEST API using APITester online ####
If you want to **quickly test** the API without installing any application just click this link: [APITester](https://apitester.com/shared/checks/2150050adf2a46b48d9efb0958b4a1e8)
then click the **Test** button. The payload (json data) has alrady been included in  body section.

The data payload example:
```json
{
	"strings": [
		"a",
		"b",
		"c",
		"d",
		"e",
		"f",
		"g",
		"h",
